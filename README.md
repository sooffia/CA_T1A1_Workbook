## Q1: **Identify** and **explain** common and important components and concepts of web development

Markup languages are crucial in web development as they define content structure, layout, and website presentation. Web developers must grasp markup languages to develop visually appealing, beneficial, and accessible websites that effectively communicate content. Developers can structure content (such as font size, colour, and style) and arrange it inside pages using these languages, which describe document layout and style through annotations like tags or elements. Examples are content structures specified with explicit tags using descriptive syntax, like in HTML and XML. Semantic markup, such as HTML components (lists, tables, and paragraphs) and header tags (H1, H2, and H3), helps search engines comprehend the context and hierarchy of material, which enhances indexing and visibility in search results (1).

## ** Q2: **Define** the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet: 

> ## **Explain**  how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

### Packets:
Packet's primary features for the growth of the internet are their capacity to improve the scalability, dependability, and efficiency of data transfer. The little units in which data is divided and sent over the internet are called "packets." Packet segmentation, which separates data into smaller pieces, is one essential component. This segmentation enables more efficient transmission since smaller packets are less likely to be missed or distorted during transfer. More efficient transmission is made possible by this segmentation, as smaller packets have a lower probability of being lost or distorted in transit. Retransmitting a single packet, as opposed to the complete data stream, is necessary if they become lost or corrupted. This lessens the effect of network failures and guarantees dependable data delivery. The ability of individual packets to be routed independently along different network channels, maximising traffic flow and reducing congestion, is another essential component of packet routing flexibility. Multiple users can access and download content simultaneously without experiencing delays or bottlenecks due to its dynamic routing capabilities, which improve speed and responsiveness (7).

### IP Addresses (IPv4 and IPv6): 

The Internet functions as a worldwide network of computers, with each computer requiring a unique address for connectivity. The format of these addresses, also called IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, is nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn, with each nnn ranging from 0 to 255. This guarantees unique identification and efficient communication between devices that are connected. The figure shows two computers linked to the Internet: one has IP address 1.2.3.4, and the other has IP address 5.6.7.8. The Internet is an abstract object that makes these connections possible (3).
