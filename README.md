## Q1: **Identify** and **explain** common and important components and concepts of web development

Markup languages are crucial in web development as they define content structure, layout, and website presentation. Web developers must grasp markup languages to develop visually appealing, beneficial, and accessible websites that effectively communicate content. Developers can structure content (such as font size, colour, and style) and arrange it inside pages using these languages, which describe document layout and style through annotations like tags or elements. Examples are content structures specified with explicit tags using descriptive syntax, like in HTML and XML. Semantic markup, such as HTML components (lists, tables, and paragraphs) and header tags (H1, H2, and H3), helps search engines comprehend the context and hierarchy of material, which enhances indexing and visibility in search results (1).

## Q2: **Define** the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet: 

> ### **Explain**  how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

### Packets:
Packet's primary features for the growth of the internet are their capacity to improve the scalability, dependability, and efficiency of data transfer. The little units in which data is divided and sent over the internet are called "packets." Packet segmentation, which separates data into smaller pieces, is one essential component. This segmentation enables more efficient transmission since smaller packets are less likely to be missed or distorted during transfer. More efficient transmission is made possible by this segmentation, as smaller packets have a lower probability of being lost or distorted in transit. Retransmitting a single packet, as opposed to the complete data stream, is necessary if they become lost or corrupted. This lessens the effect of network failures and guarantees dependable data delivery. The ability of individual packets to be routed independently along different network channels, maximising traffic flow and reducing congestion, is another essential component of packet routing flexibility. Multiple users can access and download content simultaneously without experiencing delays or bottlenecks due to its dynamic routing capabilities, which improve speed and responsiveness (7).

### IP Addresses (IPv4 and IPv6): 
The Internet functions as a worldwide network of computers, with each computer requiring a unique address for connectivity. The format of these addresses, also called IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, is nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn, with each nnn ranging from 0 to 255. This guarantees unique identification and efficient communication between devices that are connected. The figure shows two computers linked to the Internet: one has IP address 1.2.3.4, and the other has IP address 5.6.7.8. The Internet is an abstract object that makes these connections possible (3).

Figure 1: How two computers conect

An Internet Service Provider (ISP) usually assigns you a temporary IP address for the duration of your session when you connect to the internet. Your computer might acquire a temporary IP address from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server or have a permanent one on a local area network (LAN). While linked to the internet, your computer always retains a distinct IP address (3). Comprehending the importance of IP addresses requires an examination of the two main varieties, IPv4 and IPv6, both of which are significant for enabling worldwide communication and meeting the increasing demand for unique identifiers in the digital domain (3). The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 has significantly impacted how the internet has evolved. Due to limitations, IPv4, which was first introduced in 1983 and used a 32-bit address structure that could support 4.3 billion distinct addresses, was replaced in 1999 with IPv6. With the introduction of the 128-bit address format in IPv6, the number of addresses available to accommodate the increasing number of devices connected to the internet has dramatically increased. IPv6 also provides more room for addresses, adds better security with organized coding, makes routing simpler by cutting out extra steps, improves how addresses are set up and is ready for the internet to keep growing and improving. These are important for making the internet work smoothly (5).

### Routers and Routing:
How do packets travel through the internet, and do all Internet-connected computers know where all the other computers are? The response to such questions is "no." Rather, the information required to direct packets to their destinations is contained in routing tables kept up to date by every router connected to the internet. In short, routers are traffic controllers for information on the internet. They act as a bridge across several networks, assisting by appropriately directing data packets. Although every router knows its networks and addresses, it may not know the broader picture beyond them. A central point connects more extensive NSP backbones at the top of Figure 2, and the black boxes in the diagram stand in for routers linking the significant networks. Smaller networks are located beneath these, while local networks with connected computers are at the bottom. This configuration facilitates effective data flow management across the internet (3).

Figure 2: Networks for routers 

A router first examines the IP address of the sender computer's IP protocol layer appended to the packet. A router first examines the IP address of the sender computer's IP protocol layer appended to the packet. The packet is then directed to the network that matches the IP address if the router discovers it by consulting its routing database. By default, the router forwards the packet to the next router on the backbone hierarchy if the network cannot be located. This process is repeated until a router with the required data is reached. Large routing tables on routers linked to major backbones allow them to direct a packet to the appropriate backbone. At this point, it begins its journey through lesser networks until it arrives at its destination (3).

### Domains and DNS: 
You might encounter a situation where you need to know the computer's address you want to reach. For example, how does your web browser find a website like www.othercomputer.com when you need it? The answer lies in the Domain Name Service (DNS) system. This system keeps track of computer names and their addresses on the Internet, making it possible for your browser to locate the right computer. On the Internet, many computers are acting as DNS servers. They hold parts of the database and the tools needed to access it. Each server only has a piece of the database, but they all work together to manage it. If a DNS server doesn't have the information for a specific computer name, it sends your request to another server that does. This collaboration ensures that your computer can find the right destination on the Internet (3).

When setting up an Internet connection, like for a LAN or Dial-Up Networking in Windows, one central DNS server and one or more backup DNS servers are expected to be assigned. This configuration guarantees the seamless operation of Internet applications that rely on domain name resolution. When you enter a web URL into your web browser, the browser first communicates with your primary DNS server. After obtaining the IP address associated with the domain name you provided, the browser establishes a connection with the intended computer and sends a request for the requested web page(3).

## Q3: **Define** the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet: 
> ### **Explain** how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

### TCP: 
The internet has completely changed client-server communication due to TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Dividing data into packets, numbering them, and controlling acknowledgments guarantee dependable transmission. TCP assigns sequence numbers when a client—a device connected to the internet—sends data. In response, the server displays an acknowledgment sequence along with its segment. The client verifies connectivity after obtaining this acknowledgment. Maintaining data integrity across networks and retransmitting missing packets are critical components of TCP's dependability. This protocol is the foundation of reliable internet communication, essential for creating and sustaining steady, error-free connections between clients and servers (6).

### HTTP and HTTPS: 
HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is pivotal in facilitating client-server interactions on the Internet. It is a standardized communication protocol that enables web browsers and servers to exchange data seamlessly. However, its connectionless nature, where each request initiates a new connection, can sometimes delay data retrieval, especially during concurrent requests (3). In contrast, HTTPS, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, has significantly enhanced the security and integrity of client-server communication. By incorporating robust encryption mechanisms, HTTPS ensures that data transmitted between clients and servers remains confidential and protected against unauthorized access. This encryption is underpinned by a public critical infrastructure, ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt and access the exchanged data. This visual representation of HTTP is denoted in website URLs with "https://," which instills trust in users regarding the secure nature of their connection, mainly when dealing with sensitive information online (12).

### Web browsers: (requests, rendering and developer tools)
A web browser is an application of software that allows users to access and interact with internet content. A browser requests web material from servers as a client when a user interacts with it. DNS resolution is the first step in this process, which converts domain names into IP addresses to locate servers hosting the material. The resource path is then included in an HTTP request that the browser makes to the server. The server sends back an HTTP response with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in response to the request. This code is interpreted by the browser's rendering engine, which creates and displays the webpage. JavaScript provides dynamic features and interactivity, and CSS stylesheets control the page's appearance (8). Integrated developer tools in browsers aid developers in creating, testing, and optimising websites, ensuring smooth user experiences. These tools help identify and fix issues, improving web application functionality and quality (9).

## **Describe** the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.
Programming languages like Java, C++, and C# utilize compilers to convert high-level code into machine code for execution. This process involves thorough error-checking and compilation into object code stored temporarily. Compiled languages offer faster execution times since the code is pre-translated into machine-level instructions, allowing the processor to run the object code directly. However, debugging compiled programs can be complex due to the comprehensive evaluation performed by compilers. Despite their efficiency in optimising code execution, compiled languages face challenges in dynamic typing, which involves determining variable types during program execution. This trade-off highlights the balance between speed optimization and the complexity introduced in managing specific programming functionalities (Source 4, 10).

An interpreter, in comparison, converts high-level programming languages line by line into machine code. It reads a line, analyses for mistakes, translates it to machine code, and then starts running it right away. Unlike compilers, interpreters don't save machine code, which means they use less memory but have a longer runtime. For the reason that dynamically typed languages, such as Python, PHP, and JavaScript, permit variables to alter their data type while the program is executing, interpreters are frequently employed for these languages. An interpreted program can be debugged relatively easily as errors are notified and lines are run one at a time. However, the machine language code created during the execution of each line is never preserved (4) (10). 

To summarise, interpreters translate code line by line with lower memory consumption but slower runtime due to on-the-fly translation. In contrast, compilers translate complete code before execution, resulting in faster runtime but higher memory usage (4).

## Q5:**Identify** TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

### Javascript: 
The introduction of JavaScript, which was created by Brendan Eich in September 1995, transformed web development by making it possible to create dynamic and interactive webpages.  Using the scripting language JavaScript, web developers can incorporate dynamic material, interactive components, and behaviour into their webpages. Among its many unique attributes are its platform independence, which enables it to run on different operating systems such as Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X, its adaptability in supporting client and server applications, and the need that JavaScript codes be embedded or referenced within HTML documents in order for browsers to execute them (12).

JavaScript offers numerous advantages, such as being widely used and having a wealth of resources, which facilitates finding information and speedy learning. Due to its client-side execution, web pages load more quickly for users, and because of its versatility, it can successfully handle a variety of web page-related difficulties (11). JavaScript's capability to transfer work from the server to the client is another important benefit. This covers operations that can be completed by the user's browser, such as form validation, data processing, and dynamic content rendering. Particularly in the case of single-page applications (SPAs), where a large portion of the logic and rendering process occurs on the client side, JavaScript helps to enhance the scalability and response times of web apps by lowering the server load (18).

![figure screenshot](./assets/javascript.png) 
Figure 4: Adavntages of Javascript 

However, JavaScript has its limitations, including the issue of visibility, where the code is publicly accessible, thereby creating a potential security vulnerability (11). Debugging with JavaScript can be challenging due to its dynamic and loosely typed nature, particularly when contrasted to statically typed languages. Due to its dynamic nature, errors may only become apparent during runtime, which makes it more difficult to predict them in advance of development (18). Complex class relationships are restricted by its limited support for inheritance, particularly single inheritance, and the possibility of a single error creating a point of failure can impair web page functioning and reduce reliability (11).

### Python: 
Python was first created in 1989 when its founder, Guido van Rossum, discovered that the ABC language had limitations, especially concerning extensibility. Python 3.0, which deviated from backward compatibility and included a new structure to reduce unnecessary constructs and modules, was released in December 2008. Python continues to be a versatile language capable of supporting multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, structured, and functional programming (20). 

One of the main advantages of this feature is the capability for developers to add Python functionality to existing software. For instance, Boost and other tools can be used to incorporate Python into C++ applications. Due to its flexibility, developers may work within the framework of their preferred programming language while taking advantage of Python's beneficial characteristics, including its large library and ease of use (19).

![figure screenshot](./assets/python.png) 
Figure 5: Python syntax 

One of its main advantages is Python's simple syntax, which renders it effortless for developers to produce code rapidly and experiment with different ideas. The vast array of pre-built modules in Python's library adds to the language's attraction. Developers can effortlessly include pre-written code into their applications, reducing effort and development time (19). Lower-level languages like C++ or Java may provide more precise control and optimisation choices in sophisticated or performance-critical applications, whereas Python's simplicity may occasionally be a hindrance (19). Even when multiprocessing is not employed, Python is frequently criticised for its excessive resource use. Python objects have a substantial overhead, occasionally requiring up to ten times as much memory as needed to store the relevant data. This inefficiency can result from memory waste and difficulties handling out-of-date items that code may still reference (21).

## Q6: A hypothetical client has sent you an email (shown in the Q6 Email section), asking for you to build them a website. 
> ### Write an appropriate, professional email response that shows your understanding of the client’s needs for the website, as well as an understanding of appropriate technologies or tools needed to build the website yourself.


## Q7: Think back to a scenario or situation in your own software development projects or work.
> ### Explain how you would do things differently if you had a chance to go through that scenario again, using an appropriate reflective cycle or reflection technique.

Reflecting on my recent portfolio project, I would approach things differently if I could go through that scenario again. Without making sufficient use of developer tools, my first focus had been mainly on writing code and adding features. With the submission deadline drawing near, I started feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the quality of my code upon having realised I had overlooked opportunities to improve the code, optimise it, and debug it by not employing developer tools early in the process. During my most recent project, I needed help concentrating on essential components of the program's functionality since I continually became buried by small details like syncing a progress bar. Frustration was a feeling that remained throughout the creation of my portfolio website. The frequent need to address little problems concerned and overwhelmed me, impeding my development and comprehension of the codebase.

Upon reflection, I recognized that my initial approach lacked a structured workflow that included regular use of developer tools for debugging and code analysis. This oversight resulted in less efficiency and potentially more challenging maintenance. Fixing immediate issues initially appeared productive, but as time went on, I understood that it resulted in a need for more comprehension of the reasoning behind the code and possible future concerns. To find and fix problems early on in a project, I would prioritise learning developer tools and incorporating them into my workflow from now on. This would result in cleaner code and a more productive development process.

To implement this change effectively, I will allocate time to familiarize myself with essential developer tools such as debugging. I will also practice continuous refactoring and code improvement to maintain a high-quality codebase. Additionally, I will take time to understand the root cause of bugs instead of focusing solely on fixing the end issue, preventing regressions, and increasing my knowledge of how code works. This experience taught me the importance of understanding the root cause of bugs and focusing on the bigger picture rather than immediate fixes. It also highlighted the risk of overlooking fundamental code understanding in pursuit of quick solutions.

I will adopt a systematic approach to problem-solving, ensuring that I understand the root cause of issues before attempting fixes. This approach will prevent regressions, increase my knowledge of code functionality, and improve overall project efficiency and quality. Additionally, I will prioritize learning and integrating developer tools into my workflow from the beginning of any project. This proactive approach will help me identify and address issues early, leading to cleaner code and a more efficient development process.
